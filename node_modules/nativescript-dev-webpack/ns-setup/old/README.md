# NativeScript Setup

Sets up a NativeScript project with the latest version of the CLI and runtime(s). Tested on Windows and Mac.

Usage: 
```shell
./ns-setup.sh [name] [android|ios]
```

If not specified, the project name will be 'NativeScriptApp'.

If not specified, both platforms will be added to the project.

# Linux

You need the `cifs-utils` package installed since the script uses `sudo` to call out mount.cifs.

`mount.cifs` on Linux can't follow DFS redirects and paths like `//TELERIK.COM/Resources` don't seem to work. We use the local server `//filesrvbg01/Resources` as a work around.
